The idea is to use multisource Breadth First Search. Consider each cell as a node and each boundary between any two adjacent cells be an edge. Number each cell from 1 to N*M. Now, push all the node whose corresponding cell value is 1 in the matrix in the queue. Apply BFS using this queue to find the minimum distance of the adjacent node.

Create a graph with values assigned from 1 to M*N to all vertices. The purpose is to store position and adjacent information.
Create an empty queue.
Traverse all matrix elements and insert positions of all 1s in queue.
Now do a BFS traversal of graph using above created queue. In BFS, we first explore immediate adjacent of all 1’s, then adjacent of adjacent, and so on. Therefore we find minimum distance.
